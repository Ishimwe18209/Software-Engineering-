lab 7
This lab will focus on the following areas of software development:

User Workflow
Integration
This is the final technical lab in the 1st half of the semester's lab series. Over the next week, you will combine your developed components into a final working program by implementing the actual user workflows. You will test your program in as many scenarios as you can imagine, including both proper and improper use. You will write a reflection document on this integration process. You will almost surely discover that refactoring or re-architecting code is necessary. You are empowered to make such decisions as necessary to complete the project while maintaining the fundamental structure and intent of the lab series and overall use case outlined in the OVERVIEW doc.
